**3(1)** The Convention is extended to trusts declared by judicial decisions including constructive trusts and resulting trusts.

  (2) Nothing in this Act is to be construed as requiring that recognition or effect be given to a trust declared by judicial decision in another state or a severable aspect of such a trust, if the Supreme Court is satisfied that there is a substantial reason for refusing to give recognition or effect to the trust or aspect.
