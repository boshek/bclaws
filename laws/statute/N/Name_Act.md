  the Supreme Court may, at any time, on the application of a former spouse, order that the former spouse's name be changed to the name the former spouse desires.

  (2) If an applicant under subsection (1) has minor children of the marriage of whom the applicant has guardianship or custody, the applicant may also apply to the Supreme Court to change the name of those children, but the Supreme Court, before making an order under subsection (1) in respect of those children, must require the written consent of all other parents.

  (3) If the Supreme Court renders a judgment granting a divorce, it may, at the same time and whether or not claimed in the petition for divorce or by motion in the divorce proceeding, order that the name of a spouse be changed to the name the spouse desires, to become effective on the same day as the judgment granting the divorce.
