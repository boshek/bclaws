  (2) Money owing, payable or accruing due from the government, or from an agent of the government, or from any board or commission appointed by or acting under the government as salary or wages to any public servant may be attached under this Part the same as money owing, payable or accruing due from any other person, and for that purpose this Part applies, subject to subsection (3), to the government or an agent of the government.

**9(1)** Service of a copy of an order that states that debts, obligations or liabilities owing, payable or accruing due to the defendant, judgment debtor or person liable to satisfy the judgment or order are attached or notice of it to the garnishee in a manner the judge or registrar directs, binds the debts, obligations or liabilities in the garnishee's hands from the time of service or notice.

## Amount attached limited to amount due and reasonable costs


**10** In the garnishing order, the amount attached is limited to the amount due or claimed to be due by the defendant, judgment debtor or person liable to satisfy the judgment or order, along with a reasonable sum for costs.


## When judge may order payment by garnishee with costs


**11** If the garnishee does not

  - (a) at once pay into court the amounts payable for the debts, obligations and liabilities attached or the amount limited by the garnishing order, and does not dispute the debts, obligations and liabilities, or one or more of them claimed to be due, owing or payable from the garnishee to the defendant, judgment debtor or person liable under the judgment or order for the payment of money, or

  - (b) appear on notice to the garnishee,

  then a judge may order the garnishee

  - (c) to pay into court the amount appearing due from the garnishee, or as much of it as may be sufficient to satisfy the principal judgment or order and the costs of the garnishing proceedings, or an amount estimated to be sufficient to satisfy the judgment expected to be recovered and costs, and also the costs of the garnishing proceedings, or

  - (d) if judgment has been recovered or an order for the payment of money made, to pay to the person entitled the amount appearing due from the garnishee, or sufficient of it to satisfy the principal judgment or order, and the costs of the garnishing proceedings.


## Payment out of court


**12(1)** An order must not be made for payment out of court of money paid in by the garnishee or for payment by the garnishee to the person entitled, without notice to the defendant, judgment debtor, or person liable on the principal judgment or order, unless a judge, under special circumstances, dispenses with notice.

  (2) If it is made to appear to the judge that prompt personal service of the notice required under subsection (1) cannot be effected, the judge may make an order for substituted or other service, by letter, public advertisement or otherwise, as may be just.


## Payment out of court without order


**13(1)** Money paid into court under garnishing proceedings may be paid out to a judgment creditor or his or her solicitor without any order of the court if

  - (a) 10 days' notice of the intended payment out is given to the judgment debtor and the judgment debtor has not, on or before the day on which the 10 days expire, filed notice of his or her intention to dispute the payment out, or

  - (b) the judgment was obtained by default and 3 months have expired from the day on which the money was paid into court.

  (2) Notice of an intended payment out under subsection (1) (a) must be served personally on the judgment debtor, or if an order for substituted or other service has been made under section 9 (5), the notice may be served in the same manner as provided in the order.

  (3) Notice of an intended payment out under subsection (1) (a) of money paid into court under a garnishing order issued out of the Provincial Court in respect of a proceeding under the Small Claims Act may be served by mailing a copy to the person to be served by registered mail to the last known post office address of that person.

  (4) Money paid into court under garnishing proceedings may be paid out to a plaintiff or his or her solicitor without any order of the court if the consent in writing of the defendant to the payment out is filed with the registrar or judge, setting out the exact amount to be paid out.

  (5) Payment out must not be made under subsection (1) or (4) if it is suggested in the course of the garnishing proceedings that the money belongs to or is claimed by a third person, or that any third person has a lien or charge on it.


## Execution may issue on order


**14** Execution or other proceedings may be taken to enforce the order.


## Order may apply to debt not matured


**15** If the claim or demand is not due at the time of the attachment, an order may be made for payment of it at maturity, and execution may issue for it when it matures.


## If garnishee disputes debt, issue may be tried


**16** If the garnishee disputes his or her liability, a judge, instead of making an order for payment into court or otherwise, may order that any issue or question necessary for determining the liability of the garnishee be tried or determined in any manner in which an issue or question in any action may be tried or determined.


## Judge may order appearance of third person


**17** If, after an order for the attachment of debts, obligations or liabilities has been made, it is suggested by the garnishee that the debt, obligation or liability sought to be attached belongs to or is claimed by a third person, or that a third person has a lien or charge on it, a judge may order the third person to appear and to state the nature and particulars of his or her claim on it.


## Order for trial or payment on hearing third person


**18** After hearing the allegations of the third person under the order, and of any other person whom the judge, by the same or a subsequent order, may order to appear, or if the third person or other person does not appear when ordered, the judge may order payment by the garnishee, or may order any issue or question to be tried or determined, and may bar the claim of the third person or other person, or may make any other order as the judge sees fit, on terms, in all cases with respect to the lien or charge, if any, of the third person and as to costs, as the judge thinks just and reasonable.


## Judge may take evidence in chambers


**19** A judge may take evidence on and hear and dispose of summarily, in chambers, any question as to the liability of the garnishee, or as to the claim of a third party or other person, without directing a formal trial of an issue.


## Garnishee entitled to costs on complying with order


**20(1)** The garnishee on paying into court the amounts payable for the debts, obligations and liabilities attached, or the amount limited by the garnishing order, or on complying with an order of the court made about the debts, obligations or liabilities due or owing by the garnishee, is entitled to his or her costs as between solicitor and client.

  (2) The costs, if not ordered to be satisfied in another way, must be paid by the garnishing plaintiff.

  (3) This section does not apply if the garnishee unsuccessfully resists payment, either in whole or in part, in which case the judge must deal with the costs.


## Payment into court is valid discharge


**21** Payment by the garnishee into court of the amounts payable for the debts, obligations and liabilities attached, or the amount limited by the garnishing order or in compliance with an order of a judge, or satisfaction of the order, either by execution, levied or otherwise, under any proceeding as aforesaid, is a valid discharge as against the defendant debtor to the amount paid, levied or otherwise made, although the proceeding may be set aside or the judgment reversed.


## Debt attachment book to be kept by registrar


**22(1)** Each registrar or judge must keep a debt attachment book, and in that book entries must be made of the garnishing order and all proceedings on it, with names, dates and statements of the amount recovered.

  (2) The debt attachment book may be searched and copies of any entries made in it may be taken by a person on application to the registrar or judge.


## Procedure is regulated by this Part


**23** All matters referred to in sections 1 to 22 are governed by this Part, despite any Rules of Court on the subject.


## Procedure in attaching partnership, firm or company debts


**24(1)** In addition to all other powers vested in the Supreme Court, a judge or registrar of that court may, on the application of a plaintiff or judgment creditor, on an affidavit similar to an affidavit required under section 3, order that all debts stated by affidavit to be, or believed to be, owing or accruing from a partnership, firm or company to the judgment debtor or defendant are attached to answer the judgment debt or judgment to be recovered.

  (2) The same proceedings must be had as an execution against the partnership, firm or company and otherwise as if the order had been made on an individual debtor, and process may issue against the partnership, firm or company in the name of the partnership, firm or company in the same manner as may now be done in any action or other proceeding.

  (3) This section applies to proceedings in the Provincial Court.


## Service of attaching order on partnership, firm or company


**25** Service of the order referred to in section 24 (1) on any member of a partnership, firm or secretary of a company, at its usual place of business, if any, in British Columbia, or on an authorized agent of the partnership, firm or company, is sufficient for all purposes.


## Different debts may be included in one order


**26** A judge or a registrar may make an order attaching any number of debts owing from different debtors to the judgment debtor or defendant, and the service of a notice of the purport of the order, with information on where the order can be seen, is sufficient to bind the debts in the hands of the garnishees.


## Garnishment not to affect employment


**27(1)** An employer must not dismiss or demote an employee or terminate a contract of employment of an employee merely because of the service of a garnishing order on the employer issued under this Part for that employee.

  (2) An employer who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of not more than $500, or to imprisonment for a term of not more than 3 months, or to both.

  (3) In addition to the penalty imposed under subsection (2),

  - (a) the employer must at once reinstate the employee in his or her employment on the terms and conditions that were in effect before the offence, and

  - (b) the employee is entitled to wages and benefits from the date of the offence to the date of the information and, to the extent ordered by the judge, from the date of the information to reinstatement, but only if the information is sworn within 14 days of the offence.


## Definitions and interpretation for Part


**28(1)** In this Part:

"judgment" means a judgment or order of a court in a civil proceeding if money is made payable and includes an award in an arbitration proceeding if the award, under the law in force in the state where it was made, has become enforceable in the same manner as a judgment given by a court in that state, but does not include an order for the periodical payment of money as support, alimony or maintenance for a spouse, a former spouse, a reputed spouse, a child or any other dependant of the person against whom the order was made;

"judgment creditor" means the person who obtained the judgment, and includes the person's executors, administrators, successors and assigns;

"judgment debtor" means the person against whom the judgment was given, and includes any person against whom the judgment is enforceable in the state in which it was given;

"original court" in relation to a judgment means the court that gave the judgment;

"registering court", in relation to a judgment, means the court in which the judgment is registered under this Part.

  (2) All references in this Part to personal service mean actual delivery of the process, notice or other document to be served, to the person to be served with it personally, and service must not be held not to be personal service merely because the service is effected outside the state of the original court.


## Application for registration of judgment


**29(1)** If a judgment has been given in a court in a reciprocating state, the judgment creditor may apply to have the judgment registered in the Supreme Court unless

  - (a) the time for enforcement has expired in the reciprocating state, or

  (1.1) On application under subsection (1), the Supreme Court may order that the judgment be registered.

  (2) An order for registration under this Part may be made without notice to any person in any case in which

  - (a) the judgment debtor

(ii) although not personally served, appeared or defended, or attorned or otherwise submitted to the jurisdiction of the original court, and

  - (b) under the law in force in the state where the judgment was made,
