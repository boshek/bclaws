## Definitions


**1** In this Act:

"land" extends to all freehold tenements, whether corporeal or incorporeal, or any undivided part or share in it;

"parties" includes any corporation or body collegiate, and an individual.


## Effect of deed


**2** If a deed of land made according to the form in Schedule 1, or any other deed of land expressed to be made under this Act, the Short Form of Deeds Act or the Real Property Conveyance Act or referring to any of them, contains any of the forms of words in column 1 of Schedule 2, and distinguished by any number in it, the deed has the same effect and is to be construed as if it contained the form of words in column 2 of Schedule 2, and distinguished by the same number that is annexed to the form of words used in that deed, but it is not necessary in the deed to insert that number.


## Deed to include all buildings, reversions and estate


**3** Every deed under section 2, unless an exception is specially made in it, includes all buildings, yards, gardens, orchards, commons, trees, woods, underwoods, mounds, fences, hedges, ditches, ways, waters, watercourses, lights, liberties, privileges, easements, profits, commodities, emoluments, hereditaments and appurtenances to the land comprised in it, belonging or in any way appertaining to it, or demised, held, used, occupied and enjoyed with it, or taken or known as part or parcel of it, and if it purports to convey an estate in fee simple, also the reversions, remainders, yearly and other rents, issues and profits of the land, and every part and parcel of it, and all the estate, right, title, interest, inheritance, use, trust, property, profit, possession, claim and demand, both at law and in equity, of the grantor in, to, out of or on the land, and every part and parcel of it, with their and all of their appurtenances.


## Validity of deed failing to take effect by this Part


**4** A deed or part of a deed that fails to take effect by this Part is nevertheless as effectual, and binds the parties to it, as far as the rules of law and equity will permit, as if this Part had not been enacted.


## Effect of lease


**5** If a lease of land made according to the form in Schedule 3, or any other lease of land expressed to be made under this Act, the Short Form of Leases Act or the Leaseholds Act or referring to any of them, contains any of the forms of words in column 1 of Schedule 4, and distinguished by any number in it, the lease has the same effect and is to be construed as if it contained the form of words in column 2 of Schedule 4, and distinguished by the same number as is annexed to the form of words used in that lease, but it is not necessary in the lease to insert that number.


## Lease to include all buildings


**6** Every lease under section 5, unless an exception is specially made in it, includes all buildings, yards, gardens, cellars, ancient and other lights, paths, passages, ways, waters, watercourses, liberties, privileges, easements, profits, commodities, emoluments, hereditaments and appurtenances to the land.


## Validity of lease failing to take effect by this Part


**7** A lease or part of a lease that fails to take effect by this Part is nevertheless as effectual, and binds the parties to it, as far as the rules of law and equity will permit, as if this Part had not been enacted.


## Covenants not to assign or sublet


**8(1)** Unless an exception is specially made in the lease, all covenants not to assign or sublet without leave entered into by a lessee in a lease under this Part run with the land demised, and bind the heirs, executors, administrators and assigns of the lessee, whether mentioned in the lease or not.

  (2) The proviso for re-entry contained in Schedule 4 applies, when inserted in a lease, to a breach of an affirmative or negative covenant.


## Effect of mortgage


**9** If a mortgage of land made according to the form in Schedule 5, or any other mortgage of land expressed to be made under this Act, the Short Form of Mortgages Act or the Mortgages Statutory Form Act or referring to any of them, contains any of the forms of words in column 1 of Schedule 6, and distinguished by any number in it, that mortgage has the same effect and is to be construed as if it contained the form of words in column 2 of Schedule 6, and distinguished by the same number that is annexed to the form of words used in that mortgage, but it is not necessary in the mortgage to insert that number.


## Mortgage to include all buildings, reversions and
          estate


**10** Every mortgage under section 9, unless an exception is specially made in it, includes all buildings, yards, gardens, orchards, commons, trees, woods, underwoods, mounds, fences, hedges, ditches, ways, waters, watercourses, lights, liberties, privileges, easements, profits, commodities, emoluments, hereditaments and appurtenances to the land comprised in it, belonging or in any way appertaining to it, or demised, held, used, occupied and enjoyed with it, or taken or known as part or parcel of it, and if it purports to convey an estate in fee, also the reversions, remainders, yearly and other rents, issues and profits of the land, and of every part and parcel of it, and all the estate, right, title, interest, inheritance, use, trust, property, profit, possession, claim and demand, at law and in equity of the grantor in, to, out of or on the land, and all part and parcel of it, with their and all of their appurtenances, subject to the reservations, limitations, provisoes and conditions contained in the grant of the land from the Crown.


## Taxation of bills


**11** In taxing a bill for preparing and executing a deed, lease or mortgage under this Act, the taxing officer, in estimating the proper sum to be charged, must consider not the length of the document but the skill and labour employed and responsibility incurred in the preparation of it.


## Validity of mortgage failing to take effect by this
          Part


**12** A mortgage or part of a mortgage that fails to take effect by this Part is nevertheless as effectual to bind the parties to it as if this Part had not been enacted.


## Schedules and directions form part of Act
